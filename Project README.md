# Project-3-
Comparing historical data from U.S. Recessions - when the U.S. sneezes, does the rest of the world get a cold?



Your visualization must include a Python Flask powered RESTful API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.)

Your project should fall into one of the below four tracks: 
1. A custom "creative" D3.js project (i.e. non-standard graph or chart)

2. A combination of Web Scraping and Leaflet or Plotly

3. A dashboard page with multiple charts all updating from the same data

4. A "thick" server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)

Your project should include at least one JS library that we did not cover.

Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.

Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction (e.g. menus, dropdowns, textboxes, etc.)

Your final visualization should ideally include at least three views
